# Finding LRV (Lunar Rover Vehicle)

Hello folks! I'm so excited to start this project where I'm inviting coders on a mission to find the once famous and now lost LRV AKA "moon buggy".
The story dates back to 1971 when the Apollo 15 crew (4th manned landing) had to leave the moon buggy. It's said that the LRV was abandoned at Hadley-Apennine.
